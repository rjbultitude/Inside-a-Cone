# Inside a cone 

## Info
Made using P5.js this canvas sketch creates a set of rectangles which are arranged and animated in a way which creates the illusion of being inside a cone-shaped object.

Use the "more" and "less" to add or remove sets of strands
Be careful not to add too many else you may slow your processor down.
